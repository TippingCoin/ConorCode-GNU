# ConorCode-GNU
The Conorcode libraries for python
# About:
Conorcode is a simple library for python, Protected By The GNU V3 Licence.
#Usage:
You are free to use ConorCode in any NOT-FOR-PROFIT project, if you plan on moneitizing it, move to a different library
There may be a ConorCode-Moneitization Project one day, to allow profit off my libraries, but not at the moment!

To Use This, you have to use the about() function from conorcode

Example

import conorcode as code

code.about()

And so on, so forth, you get the point!

#Modding
There is a file called mods.py, please use this as follows:

Example:

In Mods.py, type: 

def MyFunction():

      print("Hello World")
      
Then in ConorCode.py, type:

mods.MyFunction()
