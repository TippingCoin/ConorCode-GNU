# ConorCode-GNU
The Conorcode libraries for python
# About:
Conorcode is a simple library for python, Protected By The GNU V3 Licence.
#Usage:
You are free to use ConorCode in any NOT-FOR-PROFIT project, if you plan on moneitizing it, move to a different library
There may be a ConorCode-Moneitization Project one day, to allow profit off my libraries, but not at the moment!

To Use This, you have to include this in your work:

import conorcode

conorcode.about()

or say you import conorcode as code, then it would be

import conorcode as code

code.about()

And so on, so forth, you get the point!

Enjoy,
